    <Summary><strong>What command do we use to move files in Linux?</strong></Summary>

    ```console 
    # This command creates new file only

    touch newfile.txt
    ```

    # This command creates the file but first you need to write its content and escape with Ctrl + C

    cat > newfile.txt
    ```

    ```console 
    # This command creates the file and it need a string argument to redirect the output to the new file3.txt

    echo "This is the file name: file3" > file3.txt
    ```

    > ðŸ’¡ The command echo itself only shows the string on console `echo "This is a file"`

    ```
</details>

8. <details>
    <Summary><strong>What is the Linux system's directory structure?</strong></Summary>
    
    ###
    - Also known as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), is a defined tree structure that helps to prevent files from being scattered all over the system and organize them in a logical and easy-to-navigate manner.
</details>

9. <details>

17. <details>
    <Summary><strong>How does we find files in our Linux system?</strong></Summary>

    ###
    ```
    # To find a directory and everything inside 
    find DIRECTORY_NAME

    # To find a specific file
    find -name FILE_NAME

    # To find files with a specific extension
    # Here we use a wildcard *
    find -name *.txt
    ```
</details>

18. <details>
    <Summary><strong>Explain the operator (&) and (&&)</strong></Summary>

    ###
    - `&`: Is used to run a command in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal while the command is still executing. 
        - Example `sleep 10 &`
    - `&&`: we use it to run many commands at the same time but the command2 only gonna run if command 1 is successful. 
        - Example: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
</details>

19. <details>
    <Summary><strong>Explain the operator (>) and (>>)</strong></Summary>

    ###
    - `>`: This operator allow us to take the output from a command we run and send that output to somewhere else.
        - Like the `echo` command that we use to create a file
    - `>>`: Is the same as `>` but with this command we redirect our output at the end of the file
        - If we use only `>` it will overwrite our file
